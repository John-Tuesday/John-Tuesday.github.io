As a project-oriented and self-taught programmer, it is all too easy to cobble together a *mostly* working project and never fully develop the necessary foundation that is needed to build varried, large-scale projects. 

To more confidently transition

HackerRank serves 3 purposes

* Bridges the gap between *"Hello World!"* and intermediate projects
* Provides more difficult and unique challenges than project-driven learning
* Extends my knowledge of algorithms, data structures, and mathematics
* Certifies particular skills
