        ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤  Howdy! My full name is John Tuesday Picot, <em>yes that is my real middle name</em>. I spend most of my efforts 
        developing Android applications and solving coding challenges on HackerRank, although as of recently, I have spent a 
        majority of my time on this very website. Which has been tough because my foundation is rooted in Android and desktop apps.

        I graduated high school at the same time as community college, earning my ascociate's degree and high school diploma in 2018. Afterwards, I completed
        about 3 years at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign pursing a bachelor's in Mathematics. I completed .

      <p>
        I am actively seeking an apprenticeship or a junior position, ideally in desktop or mobile application development, but I am
        keen to learn all and adapt to any circumstance.

    <p>
      Small purpose-driven projects are good for teaching a lot of things, like connecting different tools to accomplish a larger task.
      Unfortunately, these sorts of tasks tend to side step more fundemental aspects of computer science, namely important data 
      structures and algorithms. 
    </p>
    <p>
      HackerRank, with its many topic-based challenges, directly exposes the purposes and efficiencies of different algorithms and data
      structures on large data sets. Whenever I stuggle with a challenge problem, I know there is a larger lesson to be learned, which
      in turn, guides me to specific topics to study that I otherwise would have been unaware of.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the more tangible realm, HackerRank offers certification uppon passing a timed assessment. Additionally, a public leaderboard is kept
      per topic, and badges are awarded for progress and rank. My accolades and stats can be viewed in summary here, or verified on the website.
